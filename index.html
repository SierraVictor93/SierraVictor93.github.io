            <h1>About</h1>
            
            <p>I am a first year Electrical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, currently seeking employment for my work term during the Spring of 2016 (May 2016 to August 2016). I have a wide variety of interests including (but not limited to): Physics, electronics, web development, software testing, and quality assurance/control.                                                                                         I am a Singapore Citizen holding Canadian Permanent Residency, making me legally eligible to work across the country. I am also available for Co-op opportunities across the world. Prior to starting my studies at the University of Waterloo, I served in the Singapore Navy as a Command-and-Control system operator, from 2011 to 2013. My side interests include soccer, music, military history, and naval doctrine and technology.</p>

            <h1>Experience</h1>
            
            <p>I served two years in the Republic of Singapore Navy, reaching the rank of Lance Corporal as a Command-and-Control system operator. During my time as both the juniormost and seniormost enlisted personnel I learned how to operate multi-million dollar communications and surveillance systems with proficiency. I also acquired soft skills like a strong sense of leadership, the ability to problem-solve, how to pick out key requirements from vague instructions or orders, and personnel management and interpersonal communication skills while representing the junior enlisted portion of my co-workers to senior ranks and officers. I also served in the intelligence analysis role, which taught me how to classify and categorize large amounts of data on the basis of known requirements to provide a cogent, concise final product upon request-I worked on and authored an updated intelligence and recognition guide for use by the Navy when encountering foreign warships in the waters off Singapore. I left the service with the appreciation of my Commanding officer-transcript available upon request.</p>
